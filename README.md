# EntropyChain
EntropyChain is inspired from the famous BrewChain (http://www.darrenbeck.co.uk/blockchain/nodejs/nodejscrypto/)
Please see the file information.txt for a list of useful references used by this project.

EntropyChain has been implemented to support:
Proof of Work
Proof of Stake
Proof of Authority
Proof of Authenticity

These protocols are supported through the chain, to validate the transactions within a given block.
EntropyChain is also implementing a multichain protocol. This operates very much like DNA / Helix, where the internal data of each node (in particular for PoX), is added alongside the transactions manipulated by the chain.
Further information on this soon.
